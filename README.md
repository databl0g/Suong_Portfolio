# [Project 1: Fitbit Data Usage Trends (R)](https://github.com/databl0g/A-fitness-tracker-analysis)
(This is a case study for my Google Data Analytics Capstone "How can a wellness technology company play it smart?")
* The goal of this analysis is to provide Bellabeat - a successful small high-tech manufacturer of health-focused
products for women - an insight into how consumers are using a competitor's devices (i.e, Fitbit tracker). 
* Insights gained from the analysis would then be used to help inform Bellabeat's marketing strategy.
### Process
* Exploring the Fitbit Fitness Tracker dataset contains personal fitness tracker data consented from thirty fitbit users.
* Looking at users' daily and hourly-level outputs for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring to explore users' habits when using tracker devices.
* Identifying trends and relationships of variables in different levels of activity using the exploratory approach.
* Focus on one of Bellabeat’s products while analyzing Fitbit's data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices.
* Providing a summary of the analysis to the Bellabeat executive team with visualizations and key findings.
* Making recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.
